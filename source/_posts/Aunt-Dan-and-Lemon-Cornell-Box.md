Honestly, I struggled with this assignment, and I don't feel that my Cornell box reflects my emotional response to _Aunt Dan and Lemon_ in a meaningful way. I tried to develop a coherent concept from the objects that I found, but I think that if I were to do this assignment again, I would approach it from the other way around - start with a concept and then try to find objects that fit.
