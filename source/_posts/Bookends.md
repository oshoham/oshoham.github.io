For the second week of Intro to Fabrication, we were asked to make multiples (5 or more) of something, and I chose to make bookends.

# References

I used this [Simple DIY Bookends guide](http://build-basic.com/build-simple-diy-bookends/) to help me figure out my materials, measurements, and process.

# Materials

- Pine boards: 6 1x6x4-1/2 pieces and 6 1x6x7 pieces (1 of each for each bookend)
- Rubber bumpers with adhesive backing: 2 packs of 16 (4 bumpers for each bookend)
- #10x1-1/4 phillips flat head screws: 3 packs of 8 (3 screws for each bookend)

# Tools

- Drill and 9/64 bit
- Phillips head screwdriver
- 90° corner clamp

# Process

For the following process, I first built one bookend all the way through, and once I understood how it was all going to work, I went back to the beginning and performed each step for all of the bookends at a time before moving on to the next.

## Cutting the Pine Board

Step 1 was to cut the pine board into individual pieces. I used the miter saw to do this, along with a [stop block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_block) that I set up using the miter saw's builtin clamp and some scrap wood from the shop.

## Fastening

Once the pieces were cut, I had to put them together. Initially, I thought that I was going to use a combination of wood glue and screws, but the wood glue ended up being messy (because I didn't know what I was doing) and impractical (because it turned out that my pine boards had a significant curve which prevented the glue from adhering evenly).

Once I realized that the wood glue wasn't going to work out, I decided to just skip it and only use screws. Before I drilled pilot holes for the screws, I used a ruler and a center punch to mark where the pilot holes should go.

I then used the drill to drive screws into the pilot holes, but used a screwdriver to tighten the last few turns to avoid stripping the screw or cracking the wood.

## Rubber Bumpers

The next step was to attach rubber bumpers to the bottom of the bookend, to keep it from sliding around. The bumpers were self-adhesive; all I had to do to attach them was remove their paper backing and stick them to the wood.

## L-brackets

I experimented with attaching two L-brackets to the front of one of the bookends (the "first pancake" that I tried to glue) because the guide that I was following suggested it. However, I didn't really like how the brackets looked and they didn't seem to make a difference for holding up books, so I didn't add them to any of the others.

## Sanding

The last step was to sand away any rough edges by hand, using a sanding block.
