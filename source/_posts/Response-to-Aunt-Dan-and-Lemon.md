# Fuchs Questions

## The World of the Play

* Space: The space in _Aunt Dan and Lemon_ is ephemeral. Scenes and figures emerge from and fade into the darkness as Lemon guides the audience through her memories. The play begins and ends in Lemon's flat in London, and there are memories which take place in Oxford and the English countryside, but you could say that the space of the play is really the interior of Lemon's mind.
* Time: Time moves back and forth, jumping across many years at a time from one memory to the next. At some points, such as when Aunt Dan is telling a young Lemon stories about her university days at Oxford, time becomes nested, moving further into the past of Aunt Dan's story, and then returning to the more recent past of Lemon's memory. Strictly speaking, all of the scenes in the play take place sometime between the 1940s/1950s and the 1980s.
* Climate: The season and the weather varies a lot from memory to memory. In Lemon's recollections of her childhood home, it is summer, and the air is "sticky and hot." Later, in her mother's memory of meeting Aunt Dan at Oxford, it is winter, and the light is gray and dim.
* Mood and Tone: The mood of the play, going by its subject matter and themes, is serious. It explores the ways in which people justify violence and killing. The tone of the play is at times soft and reflective ("Lemon: The light from the window - the purplish light of the dusk - would fall across her face."), at others passionate and romantic ("...whose lipstick was the dreamiest, loveliest shade of rose"), at others violent ("And then these filthy, slimy worms, the little journalists, come along...").
* Hidden/unseen
* Sound
