# Fuchs Questions

## The World of the Play

* **What is space like?** _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_ takes place on the stage of a Broadway theater, the Belasco, on the former set of _Hurt Locker: The Musical_. The space is modified by lighting and projections over the course of the show.

* **What is time like?** Time is linear, as the musical takes place over the course of Hedwig's performance. However, you could also say that time jumps around as Hedwig re-enacts several moments from her life over the course of play.

* **What is the climate like?** The musical takes place entirely indoors, so it's hard to say what the climate is like. I'd guess that the climate is like the inside of a theatre, dark and maybe air-conditioned.

* **What is the mood? What is the tone?** The mood of the musical is at times angry and defiant, at others humorous, at others sad and melancholy. The rock and roll music gives the musical a passionate tone.

* **What is the pattern of sound?** _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_, like most musicals, alternates between speaking and singing. The music takes a lot of inspiration from early 1970s glam rock and punk. Hedwig's backing band consists of the typical rock instruments - drums, bass, electric guitar, and piano.

## The Social World of the Play

* **Is this a public world, or private? What are its class rules?** The conceit of the play is that Hedwig is performing for the audience, so in that sense the world is public.

* **In what patterns do figures arrange themselves?** Hedwig is the central figure of the play: Yitzhak and the band revolve around her. Hedwig and Yitzhak also interact frequently as a pair. Tommy Gnosis is depicted off-stage by himself.

* **How do figures appear?** The characters are fairly exaggerated - this is a glam rock musical and they are performing for the audience. Hedwig isn't a caricature, but her emotions are depicted in a larger-than-life way.

* **How do figures dress?** Hedwig wears a wig and dresses in an androgynous, glam rock style, in keeping with her genderqueer identity. Later in the play she changes into a dress. Yitzhak wears masculine clothing, probably all black since he's a roadie, until the end, at which point he changes into "stunning female drag." The Angry Inch are dressed "flashily but affordably." Tommy Gnosis has a silver cross painted on his forehead, and probably dresses like a rock star.

* **How do figures interact?** Hedwig and Yitzhak take passive aggresive snipes at each other until they reconcile at the end. The Angry Inch mostly keep to the background.

* **Who has power on this planet?** Hedwig exerts power over Yitzhak by forcing him not to perform drag as a condition of their green card marriage, because she feels threatened by his talent.

* **What are the language habits?** Hedwig alternates between monologues to the audience and dialogues with herself in which she plays both parts. Hedwig's language is definitely the language of feelings - defiance, lust, love, anger, despair, vulnerability, and self-acceptance.

## What Changes?

* **Three images**
  * **First image:** Yitzhak sullenly introducing Hedwig as she parachutes onto the stage to sing "Tear Me Down", a defiant song about how she straddles the line between man and woman.
  * **Last image:** Hedwig walking offstage into the light as Yitzhak (finally in drag) and the band sing the phrase "Lift up your hands..."
  * **Central image:** Hedwig singing "Angry Inch", a song about her botched sex change
  * **Why was it essential to move through the central image to get from the first to the last?** The opening scene introduces us to Hedwig as a character of indeterminate identity, somewhere between "slavery and freedom, man and woman". The scene also shows us the toxic relationship between Hedwig and Yitzhak. Hedwig's botched sex change is a formational moment in her gender identity, and marks the point at which she internalizes her mother's philosophy that "[in order] to be free, one must give up a little part of oneself," which she later uses to justify forcing Yitzhak to never perform drag as a condition of their green card marriage. The closing scene completes the arc of Hedwig and Yitzhak's relationship and shows us Hedwig whole and complete, having found her other half within herself.

* **What changes in the landscape?** The lights and projections change frequently.

* **What changes in time?**

* **What changes in the action?**

* **What doesn't change?** The Angry Inch don't really change at all.
