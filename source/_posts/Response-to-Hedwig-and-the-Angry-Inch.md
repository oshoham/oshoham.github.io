# Fuchs Questions

## The World of the Play

* **What is space like?** _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_ takes place on the stage of a Broadway theater, the Belasco, on the former set of _Hurt Locker: The Musical_. The space is modified by lighting and projections over the course of the show.

* **What is time like?** Time is linear, as the musical takes place over the course of Hedwig's performance. However, you could also say that time jumps around as Hedwig re-enacts several moments from her life over the course of play.

* **What is the climate like?** The musical takes place entirely indoors, so it's hard to say what the climate is like. I'd guess that the climate is like the inside of a theatre, dark and maybe air-conditioned.

* **What is the mood? What is the tone?**

* **What is the pattern of sound?** _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_, like most musicals, alternates between speaking and singing. The music takes a lot of inspiration from early 1970s glam rock and punk. Hedwig's backing band consists of the typical rock instruments - drums, bass, electric guitar, and piano.

## The Social World of the Play

* **Is this a public world, or private? What are its class rules?** The conceit of the play is that Hedwig is performing for the audience, so in that sense the world is public.

* **In what patterns do figures arrange themselves?** Hedwig is the central figure of the play: Yitzhak and the band revolve around her. Hedwig and Yitzhak also interact frequently as a pair. Tommy Gnosis is depicted off-stage by himself.

* **How do figures appear?** The characters are fairly exaggerated - this is a glam rock musical and they are performing for the audience. Hedwig isn't a caricature, but her emotions are depicted in a larger-than-life way.

* **How do figures dress?** Hedwig wears a wig and a dress, and is probably dressed in a glam rock, androgynous, David Bowie-esque style. Yitzhak wears masculine clothing, probably all black since he's a roadie, until the end, at which point he changes into "stunning female drag." The Angry Inch are dressed "flashily but affordably." Tommy Gnosis has a silver cross painted on his forehead, and probably dresses like a rock star.

* **How do figures interact?** Hedwig and Yitzhak take passive aggresive snipes at each other until they reconcile at the end. The Angry Inch mostly keep to the background.

* **Who has power on this planet?** Hedwig exerts power over Yitzhak by forcing him not to perform drag as a condition of their green card marriage.

* **What are the language habits?**

## What Changes?

* **Three images**
  * **First image:**
  * **Last image:**
  * **Central image:**
  * **Why was it essential to move through the central image to get from the first to the last?**

* **What changes in the landscape?**

* **What changes in time?**

* **What changes in the action?**

* **What doesn't change?**
